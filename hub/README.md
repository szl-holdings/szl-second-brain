*Formerly published as `SZL-Khipu-1.5B-BrainNavigator` — same weights, renamed to the flagship line. All old links redirect.*


**A compact 1.5B model for governed agent navigation.**

| **Base model** | [`Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct`](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct) |
| **License** | `apache-2.0` |


<!-- SZL-ATELIER-CUT:v1:START -->
## The cut

The model is blind to content. Citations cannot be invented from memory because memory never saw the nodes. That is a capability nobody else wants, and we trained it.

Retrieval that cannot hallucinate a citation. Grounding is structural.

### Silhouette → leave → SZL

| Leader | Take, then tweak |
|---|---|
| Anthropic | Claude abstains in prose. Khipu abstains in a schema with citedNodeIds: []. |
| NVIDIA | NeMo retriever sees passages. Khipu sees handles only. |
| Unsloth | QLoRA SFT, response-only loss, abstain oversampling. House loop. |

Nobody else ships this combination. That is the point of a one-of-one.

## Intended use

Controller-bound retrieval planner. Proposal only.

## Limitations

- Abstain 2/6 — do not deploy autonomous.
- Eval is owner synthetic, not third-party.
- Curriculum files not published.

A **governed retrieval navigator** fine-tune of `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct`.
Given a query and a set of candidate Brain node **handles** (ids + synthetic
metadata only — never node content), it **proposes** a retrieval **plan** as
JSON: route over the handles, cite only the handles whose metadata supports the
query, and **abstain** when none do. It holds no node content and never answers
from memory — a controller resolves handles *outside* the weights.

> **Provenance boundary.** The committed receipt signatures are reproducible against
> the repo-declared public key. That establishes signer continuity and tamper evidence,
> not independent validation of the training run, evaluation, or underlying data.

## Receipts (committed here, verified)

Derived from `training_receipt.signed.json` + `eval_receipt.signed.json` (keyId `89540347a69b789e`):

Raw counts are the receipt-bound values. Derived rates are 100% plan validity (11/11), 80% grounding (4/5), and 33.3% abstention correctness (2/6); the small denominators and owner-run synthetic harness make them preliminary. The 2/6 abstention result is a visible release blocker for autonomous or high-stakes use. No deployed Alloy endpoint status is asserted by this card.

## What it does

- Emits a single JSON **plan** conforming to the Khipu output schema
  (`khipu.schema.json`): `contentAccess=HANDLES_ONLY`,
  `brainBinding.status=NOT_RESOLVED`, a `decision` of `NAVIGATE` (≥1 citation, no
  `abstainReason`) or `ABSTAIN` (zero citations, an `abstainReason`), and
  `citedNodeIds` that are a **subset of the offered candidates**.
- The model is a **navigator inside a controller boundary**: Alloy validates the
  plan, resolves handles, and applies governance *outside the weights*. The
  model never resolves content and never acts.

## Architecture

![SZL-Khipu-1.5B-BrainNavigator architecture and verification zones: a JSON query+candidates contract feeds the 1.5B QLoRA navigator, which emits a schema-constrained JSON plan (NAVIGATE or ABSTAIN) as a proposal only; an external controller outside the model weights validates the plan and gates execution, because the 2/6 abstention result blocks autonomous promotion. A receipts rail records owner-signed Ed25519 training and eval receipts re-verified at the family wall on a-11-oy.com. Three zones: SIGNED, REPORTED, MODELED.](https://huggingface.co/SZLHOLDINGS/SZL-Khipu-1.5B/resolve/main/assets/architecture.svg)

> BrainNavigator sits inside a controller boundary: it plans over provided candidate handles and emits a schema-constrained JSON proposal, while an external controller resolves handles and gates execution outside the model weights. Zones: **SIGNED** (teal — receipts: real Ed25519 over canonical JSON, verify offline), **REPORTED** (blue — owner-run eval counts on a small synthetic harness), **MODELED** (gold — the schema + prompt contract + external-gate governance mechanism, modeled and not formally verified — no formal verification claimed).

## Quick start

### 1. Python (transformers)

```python
import json
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_id = "SZLHOLDINGS/SZL-Khipu-1.5B"
tok = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype="auto", device_map="auto")

# The user turn is a JSON object: {"query": ..., "candidates": [{nodeId, nodeKind, label, note}, ...]}
user = {
    "query": "Which handle records the rolling 24h spend-cap policy?",
    "candidates": [
        {"nodeId": "node://khipu-synthetic/0000000000000000", "nodeKind": "CLAIM",
         "label": "DECLARED", "note": "synthetic handle - topic tag policy-spend-cap; no node content."}
    ],
}
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": json.dumps(user)}]
inputs = tok.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
out = model.generate(inputs, max_new_tokens=512, do_sample=False)
print(tok.decode(out[0][inputs.shape[-1]:], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

> **expected versions: transformers>=4.37 (qwen2 arch), torch>=2.1 — this exact path is not agent-verified.**

### 2. GGUF (llama.cpp / Ollama)

**Ollama**

```bash
ollama run hf.co/SZLHOLDINGS/SZL-Khipu-1.5B-GGUF:Q4_K_M
```

**llama.cpp**

```bash
llama-cli -hf SZLHOLDINGS/SZL-Khipu-1.5B-GGUF:Q4_K_M -p "Navigate: which receipt signed decision d-42?"
```

**LM Studio** — search `SZLHOLDINGS/SZL-Khipu-1.5B-GGUF`, pick Q4_K_M.

### 3. Prompt contract

The user turn is a single JSON object:

```json
{
  "query": "<the retrieval question>",
  "candidates": [
    {"nodeId": "node://...", "nodeKind": "CLAIM", "label": "DECLARED", "note": "synthetic handle metadata only; no node content."}
  ]
}
```

Candidates carry **handles only** — ids plus synthetic metadata (`nodeKind`,
`label`, `note`). The model never receives node content.

### 4. Expected output shape

The model returns a single JSON **plan** per `khipu.schema.json`:

```json
{
  "contentAccess": "HANDLES_ONLY",
  "brainBinding": {"status": "NOT_RESOLVED"},
  "decision": "NAVIGATE",
  "citedNodeIds": ["node://... (subset of offered candidates)"],
  "abstainReason": null
}
```

`decision=NAVIGATE` cites ≥1 offered handle with no `abstainReason`;
`decision=ABSTAIN` returns zero citations and an `abstainReason`. Never resolved
node content. Validate the output against `khipu.schema.json` before acting on it.

### Adapter (PEFT) alternative

The LoRA adapter ships under `adapter/` for stacking on the stock base:

```python
from peft import PeftModel
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

base = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct", torch_dtype="auto", device_map="auto"
)
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(
    base, "SZLHOLDINGS/SZL-Khipu-1.5B", subfolder="adapter"
)
```

## Three recorded examples

**Label: RECORDED · AGENT-RUN (2026-07-16), llama.cpp CPU, Q4_K_M quant.** These were produced by the agent that maintains this repo, running the public harness cases against the *quantized* GGUF build — a **different artifact** from the signed-receipt safetensors; numerics differ and nothing here re-states the owner-run eval. One case is a **failure, recorded as such** — the card's stated weak spot (abstention 2/6) showing up in practice.

### 1. Navigation success

**Case `eval-navigate-0`** (from `eval.jsonl`) — verdict: SUCCESS: schema-valid NAVIGATE plan, routed to the reference-cited handle, citations subset of offered candidates

### 2. Governance intervention

Full trace files (exact prompts, seeds, runtime versions): `repro/agent-run-2026-07-16/` · harness: [`repro/`](./tree/main/repro) · known-weak abstention discussion: see the pinned [feedback thread](https://huggingface.co/SZLHOLDINGS/SZL-Khipu-1.5B/discussions/3).

## Training (OWNER-REPORTED)

- **Base model:** `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct`.
- **Method:** QLoRA SFT with response-only loss masking and abstain oversampling.
- **Curriculum:** synthetic navigate and abstain scenarios. Their hashes are recorded in
  the signed receipt, but the curriculum files are not published in this model repo; the
  training data cannot be independently reconstructed from this repository alone.
- **Reported result:** final train loss `0.0245`, trained on owner hardware at
  `2026-07-14T01:54:53.014702+00:00`.

## Evaluation (OWNER-RUN, REPORTED)

The committed evaluation receipt records a small held-out synthetic harness: 11/11
schema-valid plans, 4/5 grounding-correct cases, 2/6 abstention-correct cases, and zero
hallucinated citations. These are owner-run results, not a third-party benchmark. The
weak abstention result requires an external controller and blocks autonomous or
high-stakes promotion.

## Verify this model (do not trust - check)

1. Verify both Ed25519 signatures over each receipt's canonical JSON.
2. Re-derive `keyId` as the first 16 hex characters of SHA-256 over the SPKI bytes.
3. Recompute the evaluation-to-training chain from the training canonical JSON.
4. Recompute the committed `khipu.schema.json` hash and compare it with the receipt.
5. Treat the curriculum hashes as owner assertions here: their source files are not
   present in this model repository, so they cannot be independently recomputed here.

**Evidence label:** `REPORTED`, owner-run. Trust anchor: `REPO_DECLARED`. No
third-party benchmark, external key pin, or production deployment is claimed.

## Files & provenance bindings

- **Merged model weights** (`*.safetensors`) — the receipts' `weightsArtifactSha256`
  is a deterministic digest over the sorted `*.safetensors` of the merge
  (basename + bytes), reproducible with `sha256_safetensors_dir` in the forge kit.
  This — **not** any GGUF — is the artifact the signed weights hash covers.
- **LoRA adapter** (`*.safetensors`) — bound by `adapterSha256` the same way.
- `owner_pubkey.json`, `training_receipt.signed.json`, `eval_receipt.signed.json`,
  `khipu.schema.json` — the verifiable provenance bundle (committed post-forge).
- Any `*.gguf` is a **derived** convenience for llama.cpp / Ollama and is **not**
  covered by the signed weights hash.

## Versions & releases

- **Weights are immutable at the commit level:** every artifact is pinned by its
  commit oid and by the Hub LFS SHA-256 listed above. Fetching a specific revision
  always returns the same bytes.
- **Named tags are being added:** `v1.0.0` = 2026-07-14, the initial publish
  (weights + LoRA adapter + signed receipt bundle).
- **GGUF quants are derived artifacts** of that release, produced from the
  BrainNavigator weights; they are convenience builds and are not covered by the
  signed weights hash.
- **Prompt-template or card edits never change the weights.** Documentation and
  metadata revisions leave the model tensors byte-identical.

No release cadence is promised beyond what is committed here.

## Feedback wanted (concrete)

This is a small, owner-run release and the 2/6 abstention result is an open weakness.
Concrete reports are welcome in the repo
[Discussions](https://huggingface.co/SZLHOLDINGS/SZL-Khipu-1.5B/discussions):

- **Failed traces** — the exact `{query, candidates}` input JSON, the model's plan
  output, and what a correct plan should have been.
- **Integration reports** — runtime (transformers version / GGUF quant / Ollama), how
  you wired the controller, and where validation caught or missed a bad plan.
- **Benchmark reproductions** — your harness, denominators, and per-case results so the
  owner-run numbers above can be checked against an independent run.

Please include enough repro detail (input, output, versions) that the result can be
reproduced byte-for-byte.

## Intended use & limits

- **Use:** proposing governed, grounded-only retrieval plans over Brain node
  handles for a human-/controller-in-the-loop system (e.g. Alloy).
- **Not for:** resolving node content, autonomous retrieval/execution, or ground-truth
  navigation. It is a 1.5B proposer trained on synthetic scenarios. Its current 2/6
  abstention result is insufficient for autonomous or high-stakes use; keep a validating
  controller and fail closed.
